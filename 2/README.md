1. Instead of passing a group of individual data as parameters, 
you can pass the entire object in the method, simplifying the process 
by passing a single object. This practice allows you to group all the 
data and pass it to a function as one object.

2. Creating two new separate classes has its advantages for two reasons. 
Firstly, the first class groups isolated phone number data, which reduces 
the number of parameters in the constructor of the main class. Secondly, 
the second class helps to reduce the number of fields in the main class 
by separating functionally oriented data.
